* No need to install R or RStudio on your own computer—everything runs in the cloud.
* Ensures everyone has the same software versions and packages, reducing compatibility problems.
* Your work is automatically saved and backed up online.
* You can access your projects from any device with an internet connection.
* Makes collaboration and sharing code with instructors and classmates easier.

<strong>Perfect! You are now all set to go!<br><br>
Please only complete the section below if you would like to have R installed on a local device to practice offline.</strong>

# **OPTIONAL: Local Installation of R.** 

You may want to install R & RStudio on your local computer. This will give you somewhere to practice when you are "offline" (aka not connect to the internet). If you have your own laptop I would recommend doing this. 

---------------------

## **Step 1: Head to the The Comprehensive R Archive Network**

Head over to the [CRAN Homepage](https://cran.r-project.org/)
