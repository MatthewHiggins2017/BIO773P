# Programming in R

Welcome to programming in R, introduction course!

## What is R?

R is a powerful programming language and software environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. Originally developed in the early 1990s by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, R was created as an open-source implementation of the S programming language developed at Bell Labs.

## A Brief History of R

The story of R begins with the S language, which was developed by John Chambers and colleagues at Bell Laboratories starting in 1976. S was revolutionary for its time, providing statisticians with a flexible environment for data analysis and visualisation. 

In 1991, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman began developing R as a free alternative to S. They named it "R" partly as a play on their first names and partly as a tribute to the S language. The first official version of R was released in 1995, and by 1997, R became a GNU project with a core development team known as the "R Core Team."

Today, R is maintained by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing and has grown into one of the most widely used programming languages in data science, with over 18,000 packages available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).

## Why R is Essential for Modern Biology

### 1. **Built for Statistics and Data Analysis**
Biology has become increasingly data-driven, with genomics, ecology, and experimental biology generating massive datasets. R was designed from the ground up for statistical analysis, making it the perfect tool for biological research.

### 2. **Specialized Biological Packages**
The R ecosystem includes thousands of packages specifically designed for biological applications:

- **Phylogenetics**: Tools for evolutionary analysis (ape, phytools, geiger)
- **Ecology**: Packages for community ecology, species distribution modeling, and biodiversity analysis
- **Genomics**: Advanced tools for sequence analysis, gene expression, and population genetics

### 3. **Publication-Quality Graphics**
R excels at creating publication-ready visualisations. From simple scatter plots to complex heatmaps and phylogenetic trees, R's graphics capabilities (especially with ggplot2) are unmatched in the scientific community.

### 4. **Reproducible Research**
R integrates seamlessly with tools like R Markdown and Quarto, allowing scientists to create reproducible research documents that combine code, results, and narrative text. This is crucial for scientific transparency and collaboration.

### 5. **Open Source and Free**
Unlike expensive statistical software packages, R is completely free and open source. This makes it accessible to researchers worldwide, regardless of institutional budgets.

### 6. **Active Community**
The R community is particularly strong in academia and biological sciences. This means extensive documentation, tutorials, and support specifically relevant to biological applications.
